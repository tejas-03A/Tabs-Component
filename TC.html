            <h2>HTML</h2>
            <p>HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the basic scripting language used by web browsers to render pages on the world wide web. HyperText allows a user to click a link and be redirected to a new page referenced by that link.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="tab2" class="tab-content">
            <h2>CSS</h2>
            <p>CSS is a rule-based language — you define the rules by specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page. In the above example, the CSS rule opens with a selector. This selects
                the HTML element that we are going to style.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="tab3" class="tab-content">
            <h2>Javascript</h2>
            <p>JavaScript is the dominant client-side scripting language of the Web, with 98% of all websites (mid–2022) using it for this purpose. Scripts are embedded in or included from HTML documents and interact with the DOM.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="tab4" class="tab-content">
            <h2>Node JS</h2>
            <p>Node. js (Node) is an Open Source, cross-platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript code. Node is used extensively for server-side programming, making it possible for developers to use JavaScript for client-side and server-side
                code without needing to learn an additional language.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="tab5" class="tab-content">
            <h2>React JS</h2>
            <p>React is a JavaScript-based UI development library. Although React is a library rather than a language, it is widely used in web development. The library first appeared in May 2013 and is now one of the most commonly used frontend libraries
                for web development.</p>
